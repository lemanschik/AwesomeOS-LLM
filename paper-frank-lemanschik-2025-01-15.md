# LLM-Powered Recursive Multi-Agent System paired with Graph Based Agent Augumented Retrival.

## Abstract
Agent Augumented Retrival is the concept of a single LLM-Powered Recursiv Agent That is related to its parent Agent or a Human.

For Long running Tasks ModernBERT to speed up the process it also allows us to index large amounts of data eg big git repositorys
for content retrival if needed. This is Mainly used to bootstrap the Operating System.

To find related content we use "SimGRAG: Leveraging Similar Subgraphs for Knowledge Graphs Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation". 
a Knowledge Graph driven RAG approach that can support various KG based tasks, such as question answering and fact verification.

used specifically on the data dump files from YaCy to create context-delivery to LLMs using RAG.

Data acquisition with YaCy then becomes a pre-processing step to create an expert-like chatbot, which is specifically potent in the knowledge domain of the YaCy web crawls.
